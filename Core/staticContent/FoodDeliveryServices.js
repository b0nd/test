On such days, you can count on our local delivery people who can pick up your order and deliver it right where you want.  And not only that, they can also pay your bill at the restaurant and you can reimburse that to them at the time of delivery.",
		"Just imagine how much convenient and cost-effective it would be when you have a party at home and you’re planning to order food from multiple restaurants.",
		"You can see their reviews and ratings using our tasker review system and be assured that you’re going to get all the value on your dollar spent on the service.",
		"And the simplicity of job posting on our website ensures you don’t stay hungry for long. Just post your requirements to get quotes, pick the best offer and choose your favourite food item from your preferred restaurant. A taskMafian will soon be on his way to deliver your order."
