                                        - 10% - that’s the bare minimum required to run the servers, pay payment gateway service fees and earn bread n’ butter for the dedicated team managing the platform.

                                        - Once the task poster hires you for the job, you can get started on it, with an assurance that your payment is secured with taskMafia. Once you complete the task, you can go ahead and request the payment and a notification will be sent to the poster to release it. After that the payment is deposited in the bank account you have nominated.
taskMafia deducts a services fee on the released payment which includes transactional charge, and maintenance costs to consistently provide an excellent platform experience. A well-maintained platform helps the task-listers hire better services and enable the taskers to multiply their earnings.

                                        - Our payment process is quite straightforward. Once the task-lister releases the payment, which is generally minutes after you finish the job, taskMafia releases it into your account. After that, it’s only how long the bank usually takes to credit the amount into the account.</p>
